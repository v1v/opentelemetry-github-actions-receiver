## Overview

The GitHub Actions Traces receiver receives data from [GitHub](https://github.com) via one method:

1. Receives GitHub Actions events by serving a webhook endpoint, converting
those events into traces.

## Traces - Getting Started

Traces support is accomplished through the processing of GitHub
Actions webhook events for workflows and jobs. The [`workflow_job`][wjob] and
[`workflow_run`][wrun] event payloads are then constructed into `traces`
telemetry.

Each GitHub Action workflow or job, along with its steps, are converted
into spans.

### Receiver Configuration

**IMPORTANT** - Ensure your WebHook endpoint is secured with a secret and a Web
Application Firewall (WAF) or other security measure.

The WebHook configuration exposes the following settings:

* `endpoint`: (default = `localhost:8080`) - The address and port to bind the WebHook to.
* `path`: (default = `/events`) - The path for Action events to be sent to.
* `secret`: (no default) - The webhook secret used to [validates the payload][valid].

An example configuration is as follows:

```yaml
receivers:
    githubactions:
        secret: ${env:WEBHOOK_SECRET}
        path: /events
```
